### [#11 Better TOML](https://github.com/bungcip/better-toml "Better TOML")

[TOML](https://toml.io/en/ "TOML-website") aims to be a minimal configuration file format that's easy to read due to obvious semantics. TOML is designed to map unambiguously to a hash table. TOML should be easy to parse into data structures in a wide variety of languages.

`Better TOML` is a VS Code extension to support TOML files.

Features:

- Syntax Highlighting for .toml files
- Syntax Validation for invalid input
- Syntax Highlighting for markdown frontmatter

> Nothing better than an extension to assist you if you're not familiar with the syntax of something you don't use frequently.
