`Better TOML` is a VS Code extension to support TOML files.

Features:

- Syntax Highlighting for .toml files
- Syntax Validation for invalid input
- Syntax Highlighting for markdown frontmatter

> Nothing better than an extension to assist you if you're not familiar with the syntax of something you don't use frequently.
